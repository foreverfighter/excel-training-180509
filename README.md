#### On the use of keyboard shortcuts
> Hidden Costs of Graphical User Interfaces: Failure to Make the Transition from Menus and Icon Toolbars to Keyboard Shortcuts (2005) by _Lane, Napier, Peres and SÃ¡ndor_

> [...] It would seem natural for users to migrate from the use of easy-to-learn menu and icon methods to the **more efficient method of keyboard shortcuts** as they gain experience.

> [...] Contrary to our expectations, **most experienced users rarely used the efficient keyboard shortcuts, favoring the use of icon toolbars instead**.

> [...] The **keyboard shortcuts were, as expected, the most efficient**. We conclude that **even experienced users are inefficient in their use of graphical interfaces**.
